<h1>A better CLI navigation experience</h1>

fastTravelCLI is a fast, lightweight, and feature rich CD command replacement.

Typing out a long directory path can be a bit painful. Most tools that solve this problem give you less to type but still involve additional steps afterwards. 
fastTravelCLI allows you to easily save destinations as key-value pairs, and provides simple commands to manage your keys.

fastTravelCLI is being continuously improved, check out the issues for new features, support, and integrations in the works. 
Specifically, a fallback matching algorithm is in development for users that want a more automated experience.


<h1>Installation</h1>

Clone the repo, cd into it, and run the following based on your OS - 

```
bash install/linux.sh
```
```
bash install/mac.sh
```

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
Currently available for Unix-like OS and bash/zsh shells. May work in more shell environments but not guaranteed.
<br><br>
Compiles using go version >= 1.20.0, may work with older versions but not guaranteed.
<br><br>
Some features have dependencies:

- `-hist` command requires tree and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).




<h1>Usage</h1>


```bash
# Go to a directory you would like to set a waypoint for and run 
ft -set [key]


# Travel to that location by running
ft [key]


# You can also travel to a subdirectory of a key
ft [key]/some/subdir


# ft can replace your cd command entirely
ft relative/dir
ft ..
ft -


# ft supports relative paths in the working directory and CDPATH
ft mydir


# ft allows you to visit previously visited directories
ft [


# Traverse back up your dir history using 
ft ]


# You can also view your entire session history in a fuzzy finder (powered by fzf)
ft -hist


# View your saved locations with 
ft -ls


# To remove a location run
ft -rm [key]


# To rename a location run
ft -rn [key] [new key]


# ft is easy to update to the latest release
ft -update
# or
ft -u


# To see a full list of available commands run
ft -help
# or
ft -h
```
*NOTE:* If you run into an error opening the file `fastTravel.bin` you may need to adjust ownership of the fastTravelCLI folder.
```bash
sudo chown $USER:$USER $HOME/.local/share/fastTravelCLI
```

<h1>Common Questions</h1>

<h3>Why not just use Zoxide?</h3>

[Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)  is a great tool but the implementation is complex leading to many issues that cause it to be less than ideal for many use cases.
Here are a few examples of Zoxide issues that fastTravelCLI solves gracefully or avoids entirely.

- [Ambiguous Query Matching](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/issues/876)
- [Lack of CDPATH support](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/issues/620) 
- [No session history navigation](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/issues/839)
- [Unable to specify query for local project](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/issues/863)
- [Unable to prioritize query to match child directories in cwd](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/issues/940)

<h1></h1>

<h3>I already use fzf for most of my in project navigation, why would I use this?</h3>

If you use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to find a deeply nested directory that you access often, fastTravelCLI takes an experience like this: 
```
cd $(find * -type d | fzf)
```
```

and condenses it to this:

```


<h1>Contributing</h1>

PRs and feature suggestions are welcome. I originally made this for myself so there's not alot of structure or official-ness to this project.
