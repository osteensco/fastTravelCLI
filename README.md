<h3>CD to a directory super fast</h4>

Instead of tracking frequently visited directories which will change over time, using a fuzzy search, or even a ML model to improve the cd experience, fastTravelCLI allows you to save a destination as a key-value pair, then you can fast travel to that location by just using the key you set.

<h1>Usage:</h1>
<br></br>

Go to a directory you would like to set a waypoint for and run 
```
ft set [key]
```
<br></br>

Travel to that location by running
```
ft to [key]
```
<br></br>

View your saved locations with 
```
ft ls
```
<br></br>

To remove a location run
```
ft rm [key]
```
<br></br>

To rename a location run
```
ft rn [key] [new key]
```
<br></br>

And of course if you need help just run
```
ft help
```
<br></br>
