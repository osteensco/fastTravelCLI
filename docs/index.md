# A better CLI navigation experience

fastTravelCLI is a fast, lightweight, and feature rich CD command replacement.

fastTravelCLI provides robust bookmarking, navigation history, useful fuzzy finders (powered by fzf), and more.

fastTravelCLI is being continuously improved, check out the issues for new features, support, and integrations in the works.

## Disclaimers

Currently available for Unix-like OS and bash/zsh shells. May work in more shell environments but not guaranteed.

Compiles using go version >= 1.20.0, may work with older versions but not guaranteed.

Fuzzy finding features require [tree](https://github.com/Old-Man-Programmer/tree) and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf):

## Contributing

PRs and feature suggestions are welcome. I originally made this for myself so there's not alot of structure or official-ness to this project.
